Preforming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise's project campaign and better vizualize the data set provided in a more understandable fashion. Working with larger data sets can create an array of difficulties in understanding what the data is saying. Using Excel we are able simply organize and vizualize the data for Louise so she can easily see campaign outcomes compared to how well they succeeded and use those trends to build a stonger timeframe to goal ratio for future play campaigns. 
  Throughout this analyis multiple codes and vizual aids are used to breakdown the data so we can better compare how other campaigns faired in the alloted timeframe. Using:
  ```
  PivotTables, 
  ```
  ```
  COUNTIFS()
  ```
  ```
  SUM()
  ```
  Functions, We are able to organize the data set on a line graph the data displayed showing the outcome of theater campaigns compared to their launch date and trends based on what outcomes resulted from a reported goal. 
  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  First organizing the Kickstarter data set utalizing a PivotTable we are able to manupulate the specific data that we want to display. In this case for Louise we want to first filter the data set based on the Parent Category type *Theater* and our year. Focusing on the count of outcomes we can orgaize the table to show how well they compared in a month by month display.

  From this data we can see that the peak of successful campaigns were in the months of **May** and **June**. This trend is similarly followed in the grand total of campaigns showing us the more ideal time frame to run a more succesful campaign would be in the end of spring and early summer. This trend can be backed by an eagerness in the community to get out following colder weather which is why we see a similar trend in the fewer number of overall campaigns in the colder months. 
  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
